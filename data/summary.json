## 10. Optional further improvements (not required immediately)

- Cache summary in memory on Flask side to reduce I/O.
- Expose `/api/summary` and `/api/predict` JSON endpoints.
- Add small client-side JavaScript to fetch `summary.json` for dynamic UI.
- Add tests for parsing functions using sample `latest.htm` and `latest.pdf`.
- Introduce a basic rate limiter or lock around `prepare_data.py` when invoked concurrently.

Would you like me to generate these as actual files in a canvas (e.g., `prepare_data.py`, updated `predictor.py`, improved `index.html`, and updated workflow YAML), or do you want the raw text here so you can paste them into your repo?
